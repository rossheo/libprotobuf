libprotobuf for [Unreal Engine 4][]
=====

Link the google's `protocol bufffers` library as the third party in [Unreal Engine 4][].

Prerequisites
-------------

* Python v3 (for install and build scripts)
* depending on you building platform:
  * Windows: [CMake][] and either Visual Studio 2015 or Visual Studio 2017
  * Linux: [clang][] and Unreal Engine Source Code

Usage
-----

1. Clone or add this repository as submodule to your project directory.
2. Go into the just created directory and run `./install.py`. This will build protobuf and copy the compiled version into the ThirdParty directory of your project (`<your project>/Source/ThirdParty/libprotobuf`).
3. Add the libprotobuf as a module into `<your project>.Build.cs`
  * `PrivateDependencyModuleNames.AddRange(new string[] { "CoreUObject", "Engine", "libprotobuf" });`
4. Generate protobuf code files (header & source, ex: Message.pb.h & Message.pb.cc) of your protocol files (.proto) by `protoc` for `cpp` (The protoc executable is located in `<your project>/Source/ThirdParty/libprotobuf/bin`). (Ref: [Google's Protocol Buffers][])
5. Put the resulting files into the source directory of your project.
6. Regenerate these code files for [Unreal Engine 4][] by `regenerateforue4.py`.
    * `python regenerateforue4.py Message.pb.h`
    * `python regenerateforue4.py Message.pb.cc`
    * You should get this information: `Success to regenerate the code for UE4`
7. Include and use the header file (ex: Message.pb.h) in your `.cpp` file.
8. That's all.
